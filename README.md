# GRACE Gravity Space Missions Toolkit

Upon completion of my thesis and my science journal submission, I will upload and open-source all my routines that I have developed for processing GRACE and GOCE gravity space mission data. Most notably, I will upload my processing mode for GRACE gradiometry. This is development on a novel method for data fusion of GRACE data to extract new geophysical measurement, the gravitational gradient from the existing GRACE space-system. 

The GRACE missions do not carry the instrument to determine the gravitational gradient of the Earth. In my work, however, a new system through an elegant combination of geometry exploitation and data fusion creates a gradiometer system on-board of GRACE. 

It is my hope that with the development and open-sourcing of these routines, someone will be able to improve and create gravity gradient maps of the Earth on day 1. In the earth and space sciences, while everyone works on data and uses software, the culture of developing open-sourced software solutions to be improved on and rigorously inspected by the rest of the scientific community is lacking. I am working in my capability to change this by the development and open-sourcing of my processing platform. This is with intention of true scientific transparency.
