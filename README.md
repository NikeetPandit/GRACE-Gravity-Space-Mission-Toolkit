# GRACE Gravity Space Missions Toolkit

Database functions and three dependent processing functions are released. Functions work across GRACE and GRACE-FO space missions seamlessly. 

As I work and finalize processing routines in my GRACE space mission toolkit, I will upload more processing routines. 

This toolbox boasts novel signal processing algorithm development and analysis for NASA’s GRACE gravity space missions. I am the sole developer of a GRACE measurement of this toolbox to promote future geophysical analysis and discovery. I have used this toolbox to subsequently analyze huge datasets; billions of measurements have been reduced to reveal smooth geophysical signals for nearly 20 years of data. I have validated extensively the toolbox against ESA's GOCE, another gravity space mission. 

The toolbox employs a functional programming style so it is easy to understand. It includes a myriad of processing routines from automated outlier detection, to using the satellite flight-path movement in combination with geometry exploitation to measure new geophysical information that the GRACE missions were not designed to do. This toolbox is a mapping and analysis GIS solution, employing and automated across a variety of software tools. 

Through extensive documentation, I hope other researchers will be able to use to uncover even more discoveries about the Earth dynamic system.
