# GRACE Gravity Space Missions Toolkit

This is a toolbox for processing GRACE and GRACE-FO mission level-1 mission measurements. 

1. This work puts the GRACE missions in a "gradiometer-mode" to estimate the gravity gradient of the Earth directly from measurements through a series of spatiotemporal transformations. 
2. The software here can be used for other research work on the level-1 data.
4. Process-GM computes derives the gravity gradient. It's output are point cloud gradiometer measurements and needed to be gridded. 
5. GMT-plotting derives publication quality visualizations with hillshading put in automatically. Just requires xyz geospatial data. 
6. The gridding and visualization routines will be released soon.
