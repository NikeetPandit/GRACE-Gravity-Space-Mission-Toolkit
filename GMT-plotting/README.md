# Plotting in generic mapping toolkit (GMT)

1. This is written in GMT modern mode - GMT 6.4. Everything is automated and just requires xyz data and user input selections. 
2. Colormap limits can enforced, or be determined by the min/max of the z data. 
3. The degree of hillshading can also be parameterized to lots to very little.

GGMS05s (up to 150 terms) Gravity Anomalies plotted in GMT - Isolated to 16-32 SH using a multi-resolution analysis implemented by a dyadic sampling of the continuous wavelet transform... implemented by the fast-wavelet transform using gaussian_FIR as a base module.
